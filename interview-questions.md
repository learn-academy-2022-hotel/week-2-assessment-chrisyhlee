# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: A parameter can be viewed as a placeholder. For example, when declaring a dynamic function, a parameter should be used to ensure the function stays dynamic and can be reused as many times as the developer would like. An argument is the actual value that is being used (and will replace the parameter) when performing the function call on the dynamic function.

Researched answer: Parameters are the variables that are used when the function is declared whereas arguments are the variables used when the function is being called.

2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

Your answer: The predefined parameters are value, index, and array, in that order. The only required parameter is value. Index and Array are optional. This rule also applies to other high order functions that can be applied to arrays, which include .filter() and .forEach().

Researched answer: The .map() built in method takes 3 predefined parameters, which are element (value), which can be named anything, index, and array.

3. What is the difference between map and filter?

Your answer: map will iterate through the array and return a new array of the same length as the original array, and execute an action on each element in the iteration. filter has a built in 'if' statement and will search through the array and return a new array with only the values that meet the conditions set in the function.

Researched answer: map will return an array of the same length that is the result of the actions executed on the original array while filter will return a subset of the original array based on the conditions set within the filter.

4. What is iteration?

Your answer: Iteration is the process of repeating an action over and over until a set condition is met. Iteration can be initiated by using for loops or forEach or map.

Researched answer: Iteration refers to the execution of repetition of an action until a specific condition or result is met/achieved.

5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

Your answer: A class is a blueprint or recipe for creating an object. The difference is that an object is the physical entity while a class is the blueprint to create that physical entity.

Researched answer: The difference between a class and an object is that while the class is the blueprint for creating an object, it is not a physical object itself. Meanwhile, an object is the physical object that is created.

6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Your answer: Hoisting is the act of moving classes, variables and functions above the code that is performing a call on them.

Researched answer: Hoisting is the process of moving the declarations of functions, variables and/or classes above their scope, so that they are declared before they are called on to be executed.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. User stories: A personalized description of a feature of an app from the perspective of a user.

2. Spread operator: Using the syntax (...), the spread operator is used to copy a whole or subset of an existing array or object into another array or object.

3. React state: React state enables the developer to track and manage data in an application.

4. React props: Objects in React that are passed to components through HTML attributes.

5. DOM events: All of the interactions that occur between the application and the user.
